SSA Core Analytics: Take Home Challenge
● Background: the sales team, reps work on multiple opportunities varying in
deal size and age (life cycle of a deal). Reps RSE increases as they get more tenured in
the company, in a particular role and segment.
● Prompt questions: You are to present summary analysis to the VP of Go-To-Market on
the health of different regions for the past two quarters. The VP wants the following
questions answered:
○ What’s the total RSE by each region and segment?
○ What’s the average life cycle by each region?
○ What’s the average deal size by each region? Does classifying them into
small/big or any more categories help us find better trends?
○ What’s the conversion rate by each region and segment?
○ What are some insightful trends between different regions/segments and your
recommendations based on these insights?

● Data Definitions: Here are some helpful definitions for your reference:
○ RSE (Ramped Sales Equivalent) - A sales rep ramp cycle between 0 and 1,
with 1 representing a sales rep who should be fully trained and selling at
expected “steady state” productivity based on their tenure. Each combination of
role & segment has its own ramp duration and expected “steady state”
productivity.
○ Conversion Rate - A metric measured by:
■ ‘Number of Opportunities Closed’ against total opportunities in a given
period where status = ‘SQL Accepted’.
■ ‘Total eARR’ from closed opportunities against total opportunities in a
given period.
